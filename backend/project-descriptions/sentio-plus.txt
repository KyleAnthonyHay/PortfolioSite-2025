================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
Sentio+ is an AI-powered decision-support platform that transforms large-scale, 
unstructured customer review data into actionable business insights using a 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. Designed as an internal 
intelligence tool for Product, CX, Strategy, and Leadership teams, it enables 
aspect-level reasoning over customer feedback, grounding every insight in real 
review evidence.

Unlike traditional sentiment dashboards that only classify positive vs. 
negative, Sentio+ answers why customers feel the way they do, which product 
aspects drive ratings, and what teams should prioritize to improve outcomes.

PURPOSE & CONTEXT
-----------------
The primary purpose is to serve as a centralized "Customer Intelligence 
Platform" for organizations managing large volumes of customer feedback. Unlike 
systems that rely solely on manual tagging and keyword search, Sentio+ uses 
RAG to enable semantic search and natural language queries across all reviews. 
It helps teams navigate complex feedback portfolios, track sentiment trends, 
and extract insights from historical reviews.

The system translates unstructured feedback into decision-ready insights that 
inform product prioritization, roadmap planning, and customer experience 
improvements. It answers questions like:
- "What usability issues are driving 1-star reviews in Finance apps?"
- "How have payment-related complaints evolved over the last 6 months?"
- "What features do users in the 'Everyone' content segment value most?"

KEY FEATURES
------------
1. AI-Powered Semantic Search: Semantic search across all reviews using vector 
   embeddings, enabling natural language queries that understand context and 
   meaning rather than just keywords.

2. Conversational Q&A with LangChain Agents: Chat interface powered by 
   LangGraph agents that can answer questions about reviews with citations to 
   source documents. Agents use tools for review search, collection statistics, 
   and app listing.

3. Automated Document Processing:
   - Text extraction and cleaning from CSV datasets
   - Intelligent chunking for optimal retrieval
   - Metadata enrichment (app name, category, rating, date, content rating)
   - Hybrid stratified sampling for signal quality

4. Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis:
   - Identifies specific product aspects driving sentiment (usability, 
     payments, performance, pricing)
   - Tracks sentiment trends across time and categories
   - Provides evidence-grounded insights with source citations

5. Metadata-Aware Retrieval:
   - Filter by app name, category, rating, date range
   - LLM-powered source selection for focused queries
   - Distance threshold filtering for relevance

6. Multi-Interface Access:
   - Next.js web application for production use
   - Streamlit demo for quick testing and validation
   - RESTful API for programmatic access

7. Flexible LLM Integration:
   - Support for AWS Bedrock (Claude models)
   - OpenAI-compatible API support (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM)
   - Configurable temperature and token limits

8. Vector Store Flexibility:
   - Persistent local ChromaDB for development
   - HTTP client for distributed deployments
   - ChromaDB Cloud support for production

9. Business Intelligence:
   - Collection statistics (total documents, unique apps, categories)
   - Trend detection across time periods
   - Category and rating-based analysis
   - Export-ready insights for stakeholders

DATA SOURCE
-----------
Sentio+ is powered by the Google Play Store Reviews dataset from Kaggle:
- Source: Kaggle – Google Play Market Reviews
- Scale: ~1M reviews across ~500 app titles (subset used during prototyping)
- Sampling: Hybrid stratified sampling of 50,000 reviews
- Key Fields:
  - Review text
  - Star rating (1–5)
  - App category
  - Review date
  - Content rating (Everyone, Teen, etc.)
  - Helpful count

Purpose: Enable fine-grained analysis of customer sentiment, feature requests, 
and recurring pain points across app categories.

ARCHITECTURE FLOW
-----------------
1. Data Ingestion: CSV datasets → Pandas processing → Text chunking → 
   Embedding generation → ChromaDB indexing

2. Query & Retrieval: User question → Semantic search in ChromaDB → Optional 
   metadata filtering → Top-K document retrieval

3. Generation & Grounding: Retrieved reviews → LLM synthesis → 
   Evidence-grounded answer → Source citations → User response

4. Agent Orchestration: User message → LangChain agent → Tool selection 
   (search_reviews, get_stats, list_apps) → Tool execution → Response 
   synthesis → Conversation memory

KEY INNOVATION: HYBRID STRATIFIED SAMPLING
------------------------------------------
Rather than naive random sampling, Sentio+ implements hybrid stratified 
sampling to maximize signal quality:
- Breadth (Coverage): Reviews balanced across all categories and ratings (1-5 
  stars)
- Depth (Signal Quality): Within each category/rating bucket, prioritizes:
  - Long reviews (>150 characters) for detailed evidence
  - Helpful reviews (high helpful_count) for peer-vetted insights
  - Recent reviews (~60% from last 12 months) for current relevance

This treats each review as high-information testimony, avoiding low-signal 
noise and improving downstream retrieval and LLM reasoning quality.

BUSINESS USE CASES
------------------
- Product Teams: Identify top recurring bugs and UX pain points; prioritize 
  features based on real customer impact
- Strategy & Leadership: Detect systemic issues across product lines; inform 
  roadmap and investment decisions
- Customer Experience (CX): Understand root causes of negative sentiment; 
  track shifts in customer perception over time

EXAMPLE QUERIES
---------------
- "What are the most common reasons for 1-star reviews in Finance apps?"
- "Which features are users requesting most in the last quarter?"
- "How do Teen-rated app complaints differ from Everyone-rated apps?"
- "What issues are driving churn-related feedback this year?"
- "Why are 1-star reviews increasing for Finance apps in the last 6 months?"

PROJECT POSITIONING
-------------------
Sentio+ is designed as a consulting-grade internal analytics tool, not a 
consumer chatbot. Its primary value lies in converting raw customer feedback 
into strategic, explainable insights that organizations can act on with 
confidence. The platform emphasizes evidence-first answers, clear separation of 
preprocessing/retrieval/generation, and metadata-aware retrieval for precise 
filtering and analysis.
