================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This project is a native iOS application that displays information about 
countries worldwide. The app fetches country data from the REST Countries API 
and presents it in a clean, tab-based interface with search and detail views.

PURPOSE & CONTEXT
-----------------
The primary purpose of this application is to provide users with quick access 
to country information including flags, official names, capitals, population, 
currencies, and languages. The app serves as a reference tool for exploring 
geographic and demographic data for all countries.

TECH STACK
----------
- Platform: iOS (native)
- Language: Swift
- Framework: UIKit
- Architecture: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Concurrency: Swift Concurrency (async/await)
- API: REST Countries API v3.1
- Networking: URLSession
- UI Components: UITableView, UIImageView, UILabel
- Image Loading: Custom UIImageView extension with URLSession

CODE ORGANIZATION
-----------------
- CountriesViewController.swift:
  Main list view displaying all countries in a table view. Fetches country 
  list from API and handles navigation to detail views.

- CountryDetailsViewController.swift:
  Detail view showing comprehensive country information organized in sections: 
  general details (name, flag banner), country info (capital, population, 
  currency), and languages.

- CountriesAPI.swift:
  API client implementing REST Countries API integration. Handles network 
  requests, response parsing, and error handling. Provides methods for fetching 
  all countries and individual country details.

- CountryTableViewCell.swift:
  Custom table view cell displaying country flag thumbnail, common name, and 
  official name in the countries list.

- BannerTableViewCell.swift:
  Custom table view cell for displaying country flag banner images in detail 
  view with dynamic sizing and layout updates.

- UIImageView+Extension.swift:
  Extension providing asynchronous image loading functionality with URLSession 
  download tasks and completion handlers.

- SettingsViewController.swift:
  Settings screen placeholder (currently minimal implementation).

KEY FEATURES
------------
1. Country List: Displays all countries in a scrollable table view with flag 
   thumbnails, common names, and official names.

2. Country Details: Comprehensive detail view showing:
   - Country flag banner image
   - Official name
   - Capital city
   - Population
   - Currency name and symbol
   - Native languages

3. Asynchronous Data Loading: Uses Swift Concurrency (async/await) for 
   non-blocking API calls and data fetching.

4. Image Loading: Custom asynchronous image loading with URLSession for flag 
   images with proper memory management and main thread updates.

5. Tab-Based Navigation: Tab bar interface with Countries and Settings tabs.

6. Error Handling: HTTP status code validation and error handling for API 
   requests.

7. Dynamic UI Layout: Auto Layout constraints for responsive design and dynamic 
   table view cell sizing based on image dimensions.
